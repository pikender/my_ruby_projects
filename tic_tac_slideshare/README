3X3 Format will be string of 9 letters representing rows in groups of 3.

First 3 letters as first row, next 3 letters will be second row and so on.

Letters can be X, O or -

X : Player X positions
O : Player O positions
- : Blank Positions

Algo : 
1. Scan through string if any '-' present say continue playing
2. Else check for straight, diagonal X or O positions
3. If found, declare the winner else stalemate
4. Throw error if for both X and O positions make diagonal or straight
5. Ask for player to begin
6. Only when 5 moves are done, you can declare the winner
7. While testing and generating permutations, No. of X's = No. of O's or differ by 1 as the turns are alternate.
