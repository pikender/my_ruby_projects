Running the Program on Console

Program should be invoked as
     ruby game_of_life.rb <GRID PATTERN>

e.g. ruby game_of_life.rb toad_pattern

Installing Dependencies

1. Rspec and YAML are the only dependencies.
2. YAML comes packaged with ruby so no worries.
3. For Rspec, Gemfile is included specifying rspec.
4. Make sure you have bundler installed, if not install with
    gem install bundler
5. Navigate to game_of_life folder and run 
    bundle install
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
For Running TESTS using rspec, there is a rake task 
  rake spec

which runs all the tests

** Dependency on Rspec is mentioned in Gemfile, bundler can be used to install the same as gem

Input Parsing and Representation is done using YAML

Path to file is lib/yaml_grids/grid.yml
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Inputs are actually co-ordinates in 2-dimensional space

2. Add input in a .csv or .yml file

3. Read co-ordinates and create a grid

4. Apply Rules and generate a new universe

5. Looks simple Huh !!

**6. Add debug.log for debugging/logging - Not implemented

i. grid.yml has all the supported patterns with input and output after one tick.
ii. Ask user to supply ONE known pattern to check the grid layout after one tick.
iii. Only allow ONE known patterns to come as input as of now.
iv. Extra Grid Patterns can be added in grid.yml as reference to other formats.
v. YAML library of Ruby is used to parse the grid.yml

Program Execution Flow:
1. After taking care of steps from i. to v.
2. Generate a Grid by properly initializing the cells as per grid input.
3. Create a Ticker to apply Rules to the Grid.
4. Add Rules to Ticker.
5. Apply Rules to Grid by calling tick and returning new Grid after application of Rules.
6. Display the Initial and New Grid.
